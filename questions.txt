can your app suffer from XSS? if yes how can you fix it? if not why not?

No. The only place that I'm rendering user content is in the todo field and
it's not rendered by angular as html, only as text (no further processing
is done on the input by the server). so you can put any string inside and its ok.

Yes. I can fix it by embedding csrf token, created by the server, to each page html.
Then, each API request should include that token as a parameter so the server will
know that the client that sent the API request is in his application.
